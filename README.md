# Bakery_Forecasting_Goldmansachs
This repository contains a financial forecasting model developed as part of the **Goldman Sachs Virtual Experience Program**. The exercise simulates work done by the Goldman Sachs finance division and focuses on revenue modeling, cost estimation, and cash flow forecasting for a hypothetical consumer goods company.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The project involves building a five-year financial forecast (FY20E to FY24E) based on a set of business and operational assumptions. The model includes projections for revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses (OpEx), and cash flow metrics such as Capex and working capital. The exercise demonstrates key financial modeling skills including revenue build-ups, margin analysis, and financial performance forecasting.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Core tool for modeling and calculations
- **Scenario Analysis** â€“ Manual growth assumptions for volume, pricing, and costs
- **Forecast Drivers** â€“ Applied growth rates and cost ratios to forecast key metrics

## ðŸ’¼ Learning Outcomes

- Constructed a top-down financial forecast from unit economics
- Applied consistent growth and inflation assumptions to model costs
- Gained hands-on experience with common finance division tasks at investment banks
- Enhanced Excel modeling and presentation skills
